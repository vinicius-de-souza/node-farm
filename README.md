<h1>Node Farm</h1>

<h3>First project from Jonas Schmedtmann's Node.JS Course.</h3>

A little bit out of scope as back-end is the main focus of this course, but not necessarily useless as it gives me at leats a sense of how things work in the front-end.

<b>This project mainly taught me: dinamically replaced elements on HTML, URL routing & general JSON usage.</b>

HTML and CSS templates provided by the course itself.
