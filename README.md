<h2>Node Farm</h2>

First project from Jonas Schmedtmann's Node.JS Course. A little bit out of scope as back-end is the main focus of this course, but not necessarily useless as it gives me at leats a sense of how things work in the front-end.

This project mainly taught me: dinamically replaced elements on HTML, URL routing & general JSON usage.

HTML and CSS templates provided by course itself.
